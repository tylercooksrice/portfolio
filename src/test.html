        In this short demonstration, this video project shows Sprite moving according to the parameters of loops. Using some loop instructions, 
        the sprites either move in a circle, move foward 300 steps or spin in a circle.

        In this short desmonstration, we have the sprite draw three different shapes with the usage of variable manipulation. 
        With the variables increasing each iteration, the side length is increased and the number of sides is also increased.

        In this short desmonstration, we have this short game that gives us different point values depending on when we clicked on the 
        ball and it's location. Using if else statements, the game's main compoments involve giving you 50 points when clicking on green, 
        25 points when on yellow, and negative 25 points on red.

        In this short demonstration, this video project shows an example of of using nested if else statements as two comparisons are done. The 
        first if else statement determines if the user entered in Yes(Y) or No(N). Afterwards, if the user enters in Yes(Y), then a comparison of
        ages are done. If the user's randomly generated age is more than 7, then the penguin is allowed to swim, else the penguin is not allowed to 
        swim. If the user enters in No(N) then the penguin will simply go to the beach to build a sand castle.

        In this short demonstration, this video project shows an example of of using list by having the user type in one letter and then iterating through the 
        list to find a matching character, where the list would display one by one all the countries that start with that letter that the user typed in.
