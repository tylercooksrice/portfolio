I made changes to animations for background color when the toggle button is pressed, changing the background slowly rather than instantly. I decided to make those changes since having the page change instantly made it seem weird and forced. I made changes to the hamburger menu as it was not desktop friendly but rather more friendly to mobile devices. The Project Card Layout was also fixed to be a small box where the user can scroll to view them all. I removed some functionalities to the contact me form and added since they were buggy. I also changed some of the formatting and style sheet of the website by removing some unnecessary snips of CSS or reformatting some of the websites to make them look more visually appealing. I also added a 404 error page, which can be accessed via 404.html, which would help users determine if they are on the correct page of the website or not.
